## Requirements

To install requirements for a CUDA-enabled workstation:
```setup
conda env create -f environment.txt
conda bash init
```

To install requirements without GPU support:
```setup
conda env create -f environment_nogpu.txt
conda bash init
```

## Training

To train the three-dots models in the paper, run:
```train
./experimentScripts/train_jlonevae/train_threeDots.bash
```
The first time that is run it will take a few minutes to create a cache of
training images. After that it will re-use that cache of images.


To train the mpi3d-multi models in the paper,
download mpi3d\_real (12 gigabytes, so takes a while to download) by running
```download
cd data
source download_mpi3d_real.sh
cd ..
```
and then run
```train
./experimentScripts/train_jlonevae/train_mpi3d_multi.bash
```

In both instances the trained models will be stored in subfolder of `trainedModels`.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the models qualitatively, from the base directory start a jupyter
notebook by running
```jupyter
conda activate jlonevae
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the notebook at 
`experimentScripts/visualizations/ExampleJacobianValues_ThreeDots.ipynb'
or
`experimentScripts/visualizations/ExampleJacobianValues-Mpi3d-multi.ipynb`
to view jacobian column values for trained models.

To evaluate the three-dots models quantitatively, run
```eval
./experimentScripts/evaluate_jlonevae/evaluate_threeDots.bash
```

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves qualitatively (see image of Jacobian columns above) and quantitatively (see plot 
of local disentanglement scores below) better local disentanglement compared to baseline methods. More details
can be found in our paper.
